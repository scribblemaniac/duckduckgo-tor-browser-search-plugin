# DuckDuckGo Tor Browser Search Plugin
This project adds support for DuckDuckGo's hidden service in the search bar of the Tor Browser.

## Notice

Tor Browser now includes the DuckDuckGo onion site in the default search providers now so this plugin is not necessary unless you are using a different browser with Tor. To verify you already have this go to your search settings and look for "DuckDuckGo (.onion)". If you do not see it, try pressing the "Restore Default Search Engines" button.

## Installation
To install it simply go to https://scribblemaniac.github.io/duckduckgo-tor-browser-search-plugin and follow the instructions on that page.

## Legal
This project is licensed under GPLv3 (contributions are welcome). It is not affiliated with DuckDuckGo or Tor Browser.
